The font known as "Davison Art Nouveau" has been reconstructed and expanded by Meyer M. "Dave" Davison. In this project, reference images collected by Florian Hardwig from fontsinuse.com were used as a guide. For the lowercase italics letters, inspiration was drawn from Dave Davison's "La Valse Script". Patrick J. "Patreeko" Dempsey took charge of digitization, creating the italics, light versions, and designing most of the symbols.
