The Soft Type Collection is designed for knitters to chart out their typographic projects. Jersey is a sporty, versitile sans-serif typeface, knittable at various sizes.

Each typeface has a “Regular” and “Charted” version, and some include multiple scales so you can fit type on your knits, no matter the project's size. Check out the charted version Jersey 25 Charted.

In this collection, the number following the typeface's name indicates the height of the capital letters for that typeface.
