# PreFab CSS Elements

This folder contains pre-made CSS and BBCode elements created by other authors, which I (Khali A. Crawford) use in my World Anvil worlds and projects.

## Purpose
These prefab elements are included to enhance the design, layout, and interactivity of my World Anvil content. They provide ready-to-use solutions for common features such as tabbed content, styled boxes, and other UI components.

## Attribution
All CSS and BBCode in this folder was created by their respective original authors.  
I do not claim ownership of these elements unless otherwise noted.  
Please refer to individual subfolders or files for author credits, original sources, and license information.

## Usage
- Review the README or documentation in each subfolder for details on how to use and customize each prefab.
- If you use these elements in your own projects, please credit the original creators as specified.

> If you add new prefab elements, update this README and include attribution and license information for the new elements.
