# Spoiler Button Tabs â€“ PreFab Element

This folder contains the **Spoiler Button Tabs** prefab, originally created by [Stormbril](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/cathedris-stormbril/a/spoiler-button-tabs-article) for World Anvil.

## Overview
Spoiler Button Tabs allow you to create tabbed content in World Anvil articles by leveraging spoiler elements and CSS animations. This approach uses spoiler buttons as tab selectors and hides the actual spoiler content, displaying custom tab panels instead. The CSS handles the tab switching and animations.

## Features
- Tabbed interface using only HTML and CSS (no JavaScript required)
- Smooth transitions and animations between tabs
- Easily customizable for different themes and layouts
